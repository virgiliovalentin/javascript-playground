# Basic tech quiz
This is a basic tech quiz with vanilla JavaScript based on the mini project in The Net Ninja's JavaScript course.
This quiz uses default Bootstrap v5 for a simple styling.

On this project I've learned:
- How to manipulate the DOM
  - Get references to the HTML
  - Add event listeners to elements
  - Insert content in the HTML document
- Set intervals and make a basic animation
